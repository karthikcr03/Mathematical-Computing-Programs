# Mathematical Computing Programs

This project contains a collection of Mathematical Computing programs implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook covers a variety of problem-solving techniques used in computer science, operations research, and applied mathematics.

## Included Programs

1. **Tower of Hanoi Problem**  
   A classic recursive puzzle that demonstrates the concept of recursion by moving disks between pegs while following specific rules.

2. **Tautology, Contradictions, and Contingency Checking**  
   Logical expression evaluation to determine whether a statement is always true (tautology), always false (contradiction), or conditionally true/false (contingency).

3. **Equivalence Between Relations**  
   Tests mathematical relations to check for properties like reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity to determine equivalence.

4. **Linear Programming Problem - Graphical Method**  
   Solves optimization problems involving linear constraints and objectives using graphical visualization, suitable for two-variable models.

5. **BIG M Method**  
   An advanced technique in linear programming that handles artificial variables and infeasible constraints by assigning large penalty costs.

6. **Two-Phase Method**  
   A systematic approach for solving linear programming problems with artificial variables in two stages: feasibility and optimization.

7. **Dual Simplex Method**  
   An optimization algorithm used when the initial solution is infeasible but the optimal conditions are satisfied; useful in sensitivity analysis.

8. **Vogelâ€™s Approximation Method**  
   A heuristic used to find an initial feasible solution for transportation problems by minimizing the penalty cost.

9. **Hungarian Assignment Method**  
   An efficient algorithm for solving assignment problems, where tasks are assigned to resources at minimal total cost.

10. **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**  
    A project management tool used to schedule, organize, and coordinate tasks within a project under uncertainty.

11. **Critical Path Method (CPM)**  
    An algorithm for scheduling project activities to find the longest path of planned tasks and determine the minimum project completion time.

12. **Simple Linear Regression**  
    A statistical method for modeling the relationship between two continuous variables by fitting a linear equation.

13. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
    An extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

14. **Polynomial Regression**  
    A form of regression analysis that models the relationship between variables as an nth degree polynomial, capturing non-linear trends.
